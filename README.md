# Global-Omni-Channel-Sales-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing the sales performance of a global retail company that operates through both physical brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce platforms.

## 1. Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the sales performance of a global retail company that operates through both physical brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce platforms. The primary objective is to perform comprehensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and derive actionable insights to optimize business operations and market strategy.

## 2. Dataset Description
The analysis is based on a relational dataset consisting of three core tables:

**events.csv:** Contains transactional data spanning several years, including sales volumes, dates, and channel information.

**products.csv:** A catalog of product categories, sub-categories, and their respective identification codes.

**countries.csv:** Geographic data mapping countries to their respective regions and country codes.

## 3. Project Objectives
The workflow of this project is divided into several key phases:

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

- Handling missing values and data inconsistencies.

- Standardizing date formats and categorical variables.

- Merging datasets for a unified analytical view.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Analyzing sales trends over multiple years.

- Comparing performance between physical stores and online channels.

### Insight Generation:

- Identifying top-performing product categories.

- Analyzing regional sales distribution and market penetration.

- Discovering seasonal patterns in consumer behavior.

## 4. Key Insights & Business Value
By the end of this analysis, we aim to answer critical business questions such as:

- Which regions contribute most to the total revenue?

- How does the product mix differ between online and offline shoppers?

- Are there specific periods of the year where sales spike significantly?

## 5. Tools Used
**Python/SQL:** Data manipulation and cleaning.

**Pandas/NumPy:** Statistical analysis.

**Matplotlib/Seaborn/Tableau:** Data visualization.
